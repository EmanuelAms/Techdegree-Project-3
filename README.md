# Techdegree-Project-3
 My 3rd Techdegree Project

This project adds Javascript interactivity to a form, with input fields, drop down menus, and checkboxes.
Parts of the form are hidden or displayed depending on the choices made by the user.
Error messages and indicators (such as color changes) are displayed when the form has not been properly filled, upon submission.
The credit card input field error is conditional, displaying various messages depending on the error.
The email input field error is displayed in real time, as the user enters an address.
Thanks to progressive enhancement, the whole form is still accessible without the use of Javascript.
